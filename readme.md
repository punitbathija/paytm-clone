- Well `Tailwind-CSS` is the first `CSS Framework` I have ever learnt.

## Learnings

- I watched a lot of videos on how to get started with `Tailwind-CSS`
- After getting some of the basics I dived straight into the project where I had to clone India's Most Loved Payments App Website
- I have also made the webpage in mobile view.
- I made the webpage over three day's time and learned a lot about the popular framework `Tailwind-CSS`
- The webpage itself was pretty lenghty and took me almost **12-14 Hours** to complete over three to four days
